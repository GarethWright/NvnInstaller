This sample explains how to use executable already on target system for custom action. Executable can be a system file or any other application already installed on target system. This needs to other script, DDL or executable to package with it.

Steps
1. Start Nvn Installer.
2. Set all necessory properties in "Product Information" tab.
3. Select "Custom Actions" tab. 
4. Select "ExeCommand" for custom action type and click "Add Custom Action".
5. Set "cmd.exe" for "Exe on target system". Here I am using Windows Command Prompt, which is a system file. So no need to specify the complete path here, but needed if you are not using a system file.
6. Set "/C mkdir d:\test" [without quotes around it] for "Command Line Arguments". 
7. Select appropriate value for "When?" like "Installation" if you want to execute this custom action only during installation. Go to http://www.nvninstaller.com/help/customactions/exe-command-custom-actions to know more about it.
8. Select menu "Project" >> "Build" or Press F5 to generate MSI package.

Now execute the setup package generated by Nvn Installer and check whether "test" directory is created in "D:" after installation.
